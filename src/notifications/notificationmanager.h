 * \class NotificationManager
 *
 * \brief The notification manager allows applications to display notifications to the user.
 *
 * The notification manager implements a desktop notifications service based
 * on the <a href="http://www.galago-project.org/specs/notification/0.9/">Desktop Notifications Specification</a>.
 * The service is registered as org.freedesktop.Notifications on the D-Bus
 * session bus in the path /org/freedesktop/Notifications.
 *
 * Notes specific to the behavior of this particular implementation:
 *   - The service implements the "body" capability which allows notifications
 *     to contain body text.
 *   - The "category" hint is used to load a definition for notifications in
 *     that category from
 *     /usr/share/nemo/notifications/categories/categoryname.conf. This allows
 *     defining common properties for all notifications in each category.
 *        - Each category definition file contains a list of hint=value pairs,
 *          one per line.
 *        - Each hint=value pair in the category definition file is added to
 *          the hints of the notification.
 *   - The service supports the following Nemo specific hints:
 *       - x-nemo-icon: icon ID for the notification.
 *       - x-nemo-item-count: the number of items represented by this notification. For example, a single notification can represent 4 missed calls.
 *       - x-nemo-timestamp: the timestamp for the notification. Should be set to the time when the event the notification is related to has occurred, not when the notification itself was sent.
 *       - x-nemo-preview-icon: icon ID to use in the preview banner for the notification, if any.
 *       - x-nemo-preview-body: body text to be shown in the preview banner for the notification, if any.
 *       - x-nemo-preview-summary: summary text to be shown in the preview banner for the notification, if any.
 *       - x-nemo-user-removable: a boolean value for defining whether the user should be able to remove the notification by tapping on it or should it be only programmatically removable. Defaults to true.
 *       - x-nemo-remote-action-actionname: details of the D-Bus call to be made when the action "actionname" is executed. Should be in MRemoteAction's "serviceName objectPath interface methodName" format.
