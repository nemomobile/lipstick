 * \class NotificationManager
 *
 * \brief The notification manager allows applications to display notifications to the user.
 *
 * The notification manager implements a desktop notifications service based
 * on the <a href="http://www.galago-project.org/specs/notification/0.9/">Desktop Notifications Specification</a>.
 * The service is registered as org.freedesktop.Notifications on the D-Bus
 * session bus in the path /org/freedesktop/Notifications.
